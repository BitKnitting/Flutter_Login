# login_demo

In this Flutter project I learned how to login to Firebase with a username and password.

I followed along with [Andrea Bizzotto's](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=fDMUYq6T-67GDzX0LWIUcaBo-pN8MTU0ODcxODk5N0AxNTQ4NjMyNTk3&event=video_description&v=aaKef60iuy8&q=https%3A%2F%2Fcodingwithflutter.com%2F) YouTube videos:

I also got a bit out of the Medium article ["_Flutter : How to do user login with Firebase_"](https://medium.com/flutterpub/flutter-how-to-do-user-login-with-firebase-a6af760b14d5) by David Cheah

David's example is so strikingly similar to Andrea's that I am led to believe he used Andrea's work as a starting point.  There were a few enhancements.  Like adding the icon, using a ListView instead of a Column (which is the way we need to do it to work on Android), and walking through setting up the Firebase <-> Flutter connection for Android.
